1. Less integration
  - the assets folder in this repo is a clean slate of bootstrap less files.
  - we need this to be the basis of Sherpa.
  - Question: Do we want to separate the component less files and put them inside the component library?
    - would keep all html, css and js related to one component in a single folder
    - when new components are build it would require main sherpa.less to be edited to include new component.
